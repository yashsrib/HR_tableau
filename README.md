# What I did and learnt:
- I learnt how the filter works.
- The importance of creating calculated fields.
- How parameters and calculated fields differ.
- Parameter creation for deriving insights in a slightly clearer and more undestandable way. 
- Lastly, I learnt how to design the dashboard, so that the graphs look cool and not messy.
- Since, it is just as much important as creating all the charts.
