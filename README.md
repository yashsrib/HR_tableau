# What I did and learnt:
- I learnt how the filter works.
- Besides, I learnt why is it important to create calculated fields
- Parameter creation for deriving insights in a slightly clearer and more undestandable way. 
- Lastly, I learnt how to design the dashboard, so that the graphs look cool and not messy.
- because, it is just as much important as creating all the charts.
